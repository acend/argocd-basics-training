title: "6.2 Application Sets"
weight: 602
sectionnumber: 6.2

With the ApplicationSet ArgoCD adds support for managing ArgoCD Application across a large number of clusters and environments. Plus it adds the capability of managing multitenant Kubernetes clusters.

ApplicationSets are defined through Custom Resource Definition and are processed by the ApplicationSet controller.

The ApplicationSet provides following features

* The ability to use a single Kubernetes manifest to target multiple Kubernetes clusters with Argo CD
* The ability to use a single Kubernetes manifest to deploy multiple applications from one or multiple Git repositories with Argo CD
* Improved support for monorepos: in the context of Argo CD, a monorepo is multiple Argo CD Application resources defined within a single Git repository
* Within multitenant clusters, improves the ability of individual cluster tenants to deploy applications using Argo CD (without needing to involve privileged cluster administrators in enabling the destination clusters/namespaces)

A list of parameters, which come from so called [generators](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Generators/), render the ArgoCD Application Template to create a list of Applications.

The ApplicationSet resources work in a similar way as Helm templates do. You can define a set of placeholders `{{placeholder}}` which then are replaced with the actual value during the processing of the ApplicationSet.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Create an ApplicationSet

For better understanding we create our first ApplicationSet. Create a yaml file with the following content under `~/argocd-training-examples/application-set/application-set.yaml`
And replace the `<username>` placeholder with your actual username.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: application-set-<username>
spec:
  generators:
  - list:
      elements:
        - cluster: dev-cluster
          url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          env: dev
          traininguser: <username>
        - cluster: prod-cluster
          url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          env: prod
          traininguser: <username>
  template:
    metadata:
      name: '{{cluster}}-{{traininguser}}-simpleexample'
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        repoURL: 'https://{{% param giteaUrl %}}/{{traininguser}}/argocd-training-examples.git'
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: example-app
      destination:
        server: '{{url}}'
        namespace: '{{traininguser}}'

```

Now let's make sure to apply this to the cluster. But wait, we can either directly apply the yaml or we can create an ArgoCD Application just containing the ApplicationSet.
Let's go the GitOps path:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add ApplicationSet"
git push origin main
```

And now create the ArgoCD Application, which references the ApplicationSet definition:

```bash
argocd app create argo-appset-$STUDENT --repo https://{{% param giteaUrl %}}/$STUDENT/argocd-training-examples.git --path 'application-set' --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --sync-policy auto --dest-namespace argocd
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}Please notice the `dest-namespace`, ApplicationSets needs to be deployed within the `argocd` namespace{{% /alert %}}

You should now be able to see three ArgoCD Applications prefixed with your `username`:

* `argo-appset-<username>` The application containing your ApplicationSet.
* `dev-cluster-<username>-as-example` ArgoCD Application for the fist set of key value pairs: `dev`
* `prod-cluster-<username>-as-example` ArgoCD Application for the second set of key value pairs: `prod`


## Generators

The generators (`generators` spec in the ApplicationSet yaml) are the building block on how to specify the list of parameters that will be used to generate the Applications.
There are several built in generators. Check out the [official documentation](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Generators/) for more information.

You have even the possibility to combine multiple generators together using the Matrix generator.


### Matrix generator

The Matrix generator combines the parameters generated by two child generators, iterating through every combination of each generator's generated parameters.

* **SCM Provider Generator + Cluster Generator:** Scanning the repositories of a GitHub organization for application resources, and targeting those resources to all available clusters.
* **Git File Generator + List Generator:** Providing a list of applicatations to deploy via configuration files, with optional configuration options, and deploying them to a fixed list of clusters.
* **Git Directory Generator + Cluster Decision Resource Generator:** Locate application resources contained within folders of a Git repository, and deploy them to a list of clusters provided via an external custom resource.
* And so on...


#### Example

Example of a matrix generator which combines a Git generator and a cluster generator.
Assume that we have two clusters defined in our secrets.
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: cluster-git
spec:
  generators:
    # matrix 'parent' generator
    - matrix:
        generators:
          # git generator, 'child' #1
          - git:
              repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
              revision: HEAD
              directories:
                - path: examples/matrix/cluster-addons/*
          # cluster generator, 'child' #2
          - clusters:
              selector:
                matchLabels:
                  argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster
  template:
    metadata:
      name: '{{path.basename}}-{{name}}'
    spec:
      project: '{{metadata.labels.environment}}'
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: '{{path}}'
      destination:
        server: '{{server}}'
        namespace: '{{path.basename}}'
```

The git generator generate following output:
```yaml
- path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/argo-workflows
  path.basename: argo-workflows

- path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/prometheus-operator
  path.basename: prometheus-operator
```

The cluster generator generate following output:
```yaml
- name: staging
  server: https://1.2.3.4

- name: production
  server: https://2.4.6.8
```


The combined output is as follow
```yaml
- name: staging
  server: https://1.2.3.4
  path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/argo-workflows
  path.basename: argo-workflows

- name: staging
  server: https://1.2.3.4
  path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/prometheus-operator
  path.basename: prometheus-operator

- name: production
  server: https://2.4.6.8
  path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/argo-workflows
  path.basename: argo-workflows

- name: production
  server: https://2.4.6.8
  path: /examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/prometheus-operator
  path.basename: prometheus-operator
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Create an ApplicationSet

In this lab section we're going to create an ApplicationSet for an multi-environment.
First create a ApplicationSet definition in `<workspace>/appSet.yaml` with following properties:

* Name: `example-app`
* Matrix generator with two child generators
  * Git directory generator pointing on `applications/*`
  * List generator with two clusters, named `prod` and `dev`, both with the default Kubernetes API url `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* As name template use: `as-{{path.basename}}-{{cluster}}`
* Source repository: `https://github.com/schlapzz/argocd-applicationset.git` with revision to `HEAD` and path `{{path}}`
* For the namespace use `<STUDENT>-{{cluster}}`

In the end the matrix generator should produce in total 4 Applications with following properties:

```yaml
- name: as-producer-dev
  path: applications/producer/
  path.basename: producer
  namespace: <STUDENT>-dev

- name: as-consumer-prod
  path: applications/consumer/
  path.basename: consumer
  namespace: <STUDENT>-prod

- name: as-producer-dev
  path: applications/producer/
  namespace: <STUDENT>-dev

- name: as-consumer-prod
  path: applications/consumer/
  path.basename: consumer
  namespace: <STUDENT>-prod
```

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: application-set-example
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - list:
              elements:
              - cluster: dev
                url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
              - cluster: prod
                url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          - git:
              repoURL: https://github.com/schlapzz/argocd-applicationset.git
              revision: HEAD
              directories:
                - path: applications/*
  template:
    metadata:
      name: 'as-{{path.basename}}-{{cluster}}'
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/schlapzz/argocd-applicationset.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: '{{path}}'
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        namespace: '<STUDENT>-{{cluster}}'
```

Next check the ArgoCD web ui, you should see the 4 generator and deployed ArgoCD applications.
